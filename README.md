## Scoring Example

**Setup:**
- Game: Cowboys (favored -7) vs Eagles
- Actual result: Cowboys 24, Eagles 17 (Cowboys -7, covered perfectly)
- You picked Cowboys with Let It Ride 🚀

**Calculation:**
1. Spread: -7 (favored)
2. Actual differential: +7 (coverage match)
3. Base score: 7 points
4. Let It Ride (1.5x): 7 × 1.5 = **10.5 points**

**With Castle Wall 🛡️ (instead of Let It Ride):**
- If you had picked Eagles and missed by 8 points (negative)
- Base score: -8
- Castle Wall floor: 0 (no negatives)
- Final: **0 points** (protected from loss)
